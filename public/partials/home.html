Among other things, I am a web developer. I'm a General Assembly <a href="https://profiles.generalassemb.ly/john-thiel">grad</a>. I also have a BA in English from Florida State University. I once wrote a novella. I blog. I like to jog. I worked in financial services for a number of years. Check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnclarkthiel
