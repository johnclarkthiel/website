		<div class='container left-align'><b><p>My name's John. I'm from Florida originally but led quite the itinerant life as a child, moving from place to place ever so often. I went back to Florida for college at Florida State University, where I majored in English Literature. The experience inspired a novella that I began writing near the end of  my undergraduate tenure and finished shortly thereafter.<p><br/> 

		<p>While writing and looking for work in my first post-grad year, I worked part-time as a sales assistant at Tom James, interned at a startup called Tile Financial (where I wrote content) and followed that internship up with another at a company called HNW, Inc. (where I was an editorial intern). In these roles, I learned to write clean, professional copy, honed my copy editing and proofreading skills, transcribed interviews for print, created and tagged content in HTML for web publication via content management systems, worked with designers and developers to incorporate graphics and videos into pieces, filled newsletter offerings with syndicated media, and supported the publication process and cycle in any other capacity deemed necessary.</p><br/>

		<p>Following that, I took a job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For a year, I reviewed and approved loan applications, after which I transitioned to a Middle Office job supporting two product desks (an OTC derivatives desk and a structured products desk). This role required heavy usage of Microsoft Excel, VBA, Outlook, Word & Powerpoint for all of the teams' tracking, reporting, analytics, data visualization and marketing needs. I developed the ability to write macros to automate job functions using VBA, and I learned how to prepare factsheets, two-pagers and monthly performance decks using a combination of Excel & Powerpoint. I utilized Word and Excel to create payment memos, create processes and procedures and create instructional manuals. I also provided customer service  (phone and email) support in both roles. As a middle office team lead, I was the primary point of contact for all non-market related issues. I routinely worked with front office support, back office operations, technology, application support, trading & trade support, finance, credit risk, brand, compliance, legal and outside partners on a number of issues ranging from client on-boarding, underwriting, technological troubleshooting, conflict resolution and so on in an effort to ensure comprehensive operational support for the desks as they focused their efforts on product origination, development and marketing. While at Merrill Lynch, I sporadically wrote short pieces for their proprietary magazine, Merrill Lynch Advisor Magazine. I also obtained the FINRA Series 7, 66, 9 & 10.</p><br/>

		<p>To add to my technical skill set, I enrolled in a 12 week web development immersive program at General Assembly. While there, I completed four projects (one static black jack web game, one node.js (express.js) web application, and two MEAN stack single page applications).</p><br/>

		<p>Currently, I'm a marketing associate at Raymond James Financial. I work within the Private Client Investment Products Group, primarily supporting the marketing and communications initiatives of the annuities and 529 lines of business. This involves everything from website content development and management to conference & event planning. I also handle many of the team's technical initiatives, mainly focusing on process optimization and automation. To this end, I created a project management tool using SharePoint Content Editor Web Parts, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and SPServices, which has full CRUD capability and allows for asynchronous posting, updating and deleting of various lists, giving it single-page-application-like functionality. Using Microsoft Access, Excel and VBA in tandem with Adobe Indesign and ExtendScript, I also created a dynamic templating system for creating monthly, product-specific fact sheets. With this system, we doubled the fact sheet output (a byproduct, and ipso facto requirement, of the recent DOL Fiduciary Rule) while greatly reducing processing time. I'm currently working on a number of similar projects.</p><br>

		<p>I'm always on the lookout for new projects to work on and new people to potentially work with. Please feel free to contact me with any questions, interesting opportunities, or friendly introductions.</p></b></div>
