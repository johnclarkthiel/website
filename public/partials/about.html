		<div class='container left-align'><b><p>My name's John. I'm from Florida originally but led quite the itinerant life as a child, moving from place to place. I went back to Florida for college at Florida State University, where I majored in English Literature. The experience inspired a novella that I began writing near the end of  my undergraduate tenure and finished shortly thereafter.<p><br/> 

		<p>While writing and looking for work in my first post-grad year, I worked part-time as a sales assistant at Tom James, interned at a startup called Tile Financial (where I wrote content) and followed that internship up with another at a company called HNW, Inc. (where I was an editorial intern). In these roles, I learned to write clean, professional copy, honed my copy editing and proofreading skills, transcribed interviews for print, created and tagged content in HTML for web publication via content management systems, worked with designers and developers to incorporate graphics and videos into pieces, filled newsletter offerings with syndicated media, and supported the publication process and cycle in any other capacity deemed necessary.</p><br/>

		<p>Following that, I took a job at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For a year, I reviewed and approved loan applications, after which I transitioned to a Middle Office job supporting two product desks (an OTC derivatives desk and a structured products desk). This role required heavy usage of Microsoft Excel, VBA, Outlook, Word & Powerpoint for all of the teams' tracking, reporting, analytics, data visualization and marketing needs. I developed the ability to write macros to automate job functions using VBA, and I learned how to prepare factsheets, two-pagers and monthly performance decks using a combination of Excel & Powerpoint. I utilized Word and Excel to create payment memos, create processes and procedures and create instructional manuals. I also provided customer service and phone and email support in both roles. As a middle office team lead, I was the primary point of contact for all non-market related issues. I routinely worked with front office support, back office operations, technology, application support, trading & trade support, finance, credit risk, brand, compliance, legal and outside partners on a number of issues ranging from client on-boarding, underwriting, technological trouble-shooting, conflict resolution and so on. While at Merrill Lynch, I sporadically wrote short pieces for their proprietary magazine, Merrill Lynch Advisor Magazine. I also obtained the FINRA Series 7, 66, 9 & 10.</p><br/>

		<p>To add to my technical skill set, I enrolled in a 12 week web development immersive program at General Assembly. While there, I completed four projects (one static black jack web game, one node.js (express.js) web application, and two MEAN stack single page applications). I'm currently working on a Ruby on Rails app and another MEAN stack app.</p><br/>

		<p>I'm looking to assist with any web development, content or operational/administrative needs an organization may have.</p><br/>
